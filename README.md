This repository contains a python script and JLink command files to flash firmware onto Lura Health PCBs during manufacturing. A Raspberry Pi and nRF52 DK will be embedded within a programming jig. PCB flashing or erasing is performed by pressing buttons built into the programming jig. Flashing or erasing status (success, error, bad PCB contact, etc) will be displayed with LED lights (green, yellow or red).
